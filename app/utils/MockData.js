    "We love building apps with React Native, because it helps us create high quality products for both major mobile platforms quickly and cost-effectively.",

    "This Starter Kit reflects the best practices of React Native development we have discovered while building real-world applications for our customers. It is opinionated about tooling, patterns and development practices. It might not be a one-size-fits-all solution for everyone, but feel free to customize it for your needs, or just take inspiration from it.",
